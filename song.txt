Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn
I'm so perplexed
With just one breath, I'm locked in
Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn
I'm so perplexed
On that, it's almost shocking
I know, I know you know you're scared
Your heart, your mind, your soul, your body
They won't, they won't, they won't be careful
But I guess that you don't know me

Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
Cause space is just a word made up
by someone who's afraid to get too...
